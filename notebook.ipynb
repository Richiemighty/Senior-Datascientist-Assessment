A higher number of bad accounts suggests a higher likelihood of future default, which is crucial for assessing risk.       |\n",

This feature can improve the model by balancing out the effect of bad accounts.              |\n",

Understanding the size of the borrowerâ€™s financial obligations is critical.      |\n",
    "| **Total arrears (e.g., totalaccountarrear)**                         | Total overdue amount on accounts.                                                                                | Arrears are a strong indicator of financial distress. A larger arrears balance signals greater credit risk.                                                                                        |\n",

This feature is key for assessing repayment capacity and default likelihood.  |\n",
    "| **Employment status (e.g., currentemployer\\_duration)**              | Duration of current employment or employer stability.                                                            | Stable employment is linked to higher income stability, reducing the likelihood of default. Longer tenure with an employer improves predictability of future financial behavior.                   |\n",
    "| **Guarantor count (e.g., guarantorcount)**                           | Number of guarantors associated with the borrowerâ€™s loans.                                                       | A guarantor provides a safety net for lenders. If there are no guarantors, it may signal higher risk. This can influence creditworthiness by adding a layer of security or increasing risk.        |\n",
    "| **Recent inquiries (e.g., total\\_recent\\_enquiries)**                | Number of recent credit inquiries made by the borrower.                                                          | Numerous recent inquiries might suggest credit shopping or financial distress, which increases the likelihood of default. High inquiry frequency is often associated with higher credit risk.      |\n",
    "| **Age (e.g., birthdate)**                                            | Borrower's age.                                                                                                  | Age can correlate with financial stability. Younger borrowers may be riskier due to limited credit history, while older borrowers may have more established financial habits.                      |\n",
    "| **Account performance (e.g., amountoverdue, currentbalanceamt)**     | Amount overdue and current balance in loan accounts.                                                             | Overdue amounts and large current balances suggest financial strain, directly influencing the risk of default. A low overdue amount or zero balance indicates better financial health.             |\n",
    "| **Account status (e.g., accountstatus)**                             | Status of loan accounts (e.g., open, written off, performing, etc.).                                             | The status of accounts shows whether the borrower is actively managing their debt or whether they have written off accounts, signaling a higher risk of default in the latter case.                |\n",
    "| **Type of loan (e.g., loan type like personal loan, overdraft)**     | Type of loan or credit agreement (e.g., personal loan, secured loan, overdraft).                                 | Different types of loans have varying risk profiles. Secured loans typically have lower risk, while unsecured loans or overdrafts carry higher risk, which can impact scoring.                     |\n",

Late or missed payments increase the likelihood of default. This feature can significantly improve prediction accuracy. |\n",
    "| **Default frequency (e.g., monthsinarrears)**                        | Number of months an account has been in arrears.                                                                 | Prolonged arrears (e.g., 13 months in arrears) indicate severe payment issues and signal high credit risk, which should be strongly factored into the scoring model.                               |\n",
    "| **Loan duration (e.g., loanduration)**                               | Duration of the loan account (e.g., the length of time since the loan was opened or is expected to be paid off). | Loan duration helps assess whether the borrower has a long-term financial commitment or has been carrying debt for an extended period, which may indicate either stability or distress.            |\n",
    "| **Credit usage pattern (e.g., total\\_number\\_of\\_judgements)**       | Total number of judgments made on the borrower's accounts.                                                       | Legal judgments are a critical indicator of financial and legal disputes, which directly affect credit risk. The higher the number of judgments, the higher the risk.                              |\n",
    "| **Property ownership (e.g., propertyownedtype)**                     | Whether the borrower owns property.                                                                              | Homeownership typically indicates financial stability and reduces default risk. Borrowers who rent may be more financially unstable.                                                               |\n"
